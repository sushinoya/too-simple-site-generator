# suyash.dev

This website is generated by a single, horribly-written script - `gen.py`.
It fetches data from a JSON on a different server and builds the html file
on each deploy. So, in essence it is a very shitty static site generator.

`template.txt` is the skeleton of the pages that `gen.py` generates. The
JSON used by the script is in the following a similar format to the following:

```json
{
  "pages": {
    "about": {
      "index": true,
      "title": "About",
      "description": [
        "Paragraph1",
        "Paragraph2",
        "Paragraph3",
        "Paragraph4",
        "Paragraph5"
      ],
      "text_above_embed": null,
      "embed": null,
      "list": null
    },

    "books": {
      "index": true,
      "title": "Books",
      "description": "If I ever had a library of books just for myself, these are some of the books which would definitely be on the shelves. I haven't read all of them but I hope to be able to someday:",
      "text_above_embed": null,
      "embed": null,
      "list": [
        {"title": "The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye", "link": null},
        {"title": "The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck", "link": null},
        {"title": "Thinking Fast and Slow", "link": null},
        {"title": "Engineering a Compiler", "link": null}
      ]
    }
  }
}

```
